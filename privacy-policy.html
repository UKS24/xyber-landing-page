    <h1>Xyber Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>At Xyber, your privacy and security are our top priorities. This policy outlines how we handle your data and how our app helps protect you from common cyber threats.</p>
    <h2>1. Data Access and Collection:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Xyber does not collect or store your phone number, message content, or any personally identifiable information (PII).</li>
        <li>We access your messages only to scan for links within them. This ensures we can protect you in real-time from malicious or unsafe links.</li>
        <li>No message contents are stored or transmitted outside of your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. How We Protect You:</h2>
    <p>Threat actors/attackers and scammers attempt to target you using four primary methods:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>SMS: Attackers may send phishing or malicious links in SMS messages that attempt to steal your personal information or install harmful software on your device.</li>
        <li>Phone Calls: Scammers may use phone calls to trick you into providing sensitive information or direct you to malicious websites or applications.</li>
        <li>Emails: Emails are often used to deliver phishing links, malicious attachments, or social engineering attacks aimed at stealing your passwords, financial details, or infecting your device.</li>
        <li>Files: Attackers may send files with embedded payloads or unsafe code that could harm your device or steal your data once opened.</li>
    </ol>
